# ACE2-Helix-Minibinders

This repository implements **Approach 1** from the Science paper _"De novo design of picomolar SARS-CoV-2 miniprotein inhibitors"_ by Cao et al. (2020), focusing on the design of small, stable proteins that incorporate the ACE2 Î±-helix to block the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from binding to the ACE2 receptor.

## ðŸ”¬ Project Overview

- **Goal:** Design and optimize de novo miniproteins that mimic the ACE2 binding helix (residues 23â€“46) to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD.
- **Approach:** Incorporate the ACE2 Î±-helix into custom-designed scaffolds using Rosetta, followed by in silico optimization for stability and binding.
- **Inspiration:** Approach 1 from [Cao et al., Science, 2020](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abd9909)
